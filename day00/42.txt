cd ~ changes the directory you are on, to a different one. It seems like the new directory must be under your current one? E.g From Desktop, you can do "cd Desktop/42.txt/" but if you are in 42.txt and you type "cd Desktop/" it won't work?

pwd will tell you what directory you are in

mkdir will make a new directory under the current directory you are viewing. 

ls will list the different files inside your current 

touch ~ will create a file with name: ~

vim ~.txt  will let you open a text file

cp <> () will copy files or directories <> to a new location ()

mv will move a file to a new directory

rm to delete files

rm -rf to delete directories

banner -w 35 <> will make whatever you enter in <> apear in your directory in large font 

say <> will make the computer say whatever you want
